# Typewriting

## Features


### Human-like typewriting

Random intervals between character typing allow for human-like typewriting.

### Typewrite in bulk

An array of objects in which you specify the html element and the text to be typewrited, are all that you need.

### Typewrite with callback on finish typewriting

On the event finish typewrite, you can call a custom callback.

### Typewrite "one at a time"

Prevent the typewrite feature to be called more than once while it's "busy". Consecutive calls to the typewriting will have no effect 
until the typewriting function will have finished its work.
